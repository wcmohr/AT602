#### The Solver
Can solve for minimizing one value at a time by varying one input at a time.  can constrain other values as well.

#### Regression
Options -> add ins -> manage add ins -> go

Insert scatter, select data, move chart to new page, sequentially remove y variables to determine shape of distributions.

Generate plot with residuals chart

#### Rounding and Linear Interpolation:
Use match to find row, column of desired value, and then use offset to count down rows and across columns
